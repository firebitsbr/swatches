Description: There are numerous places to create and download color
    palettes and these are usually shared in Adobe swatch file formats of
    some kind. There is also often the need to use standard palettes
    developed within an organization to ensure that aesthetics are carried over
    into all projects and output. This package makes it possible to use
    Adobe swatches in R graphics without the need to transcribe or convert
    color values by hand or with other programs.
